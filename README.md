Network Routing Protocols

We solve the Maximum Capacity problem using Modified Dijkstra Algorithm without using heaps, modified Dijkstra Algorithm using heaps
and Kruskal Algorithm with Heap sort and breadth first search for both sparse and dense graphs. 
The results are tabulated . For the dense graph, Modified Kruskal performs the best and for sparse graphs, Dijkstra with heap performs the best.
